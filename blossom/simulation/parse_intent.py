def parse(intent_list, population_dict):
    """
    Determine whether the intent list is valid and fix it in the event of
    conflicts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    intent_list : list of lists of Organisms
        List of lists of organisms with proposed organism states,
        after each organism has 'acted'. Length equals number of organisms in
        the current time step.
    population_dict : dict of Organisms
        Dict of current organisms

    Returns
    -------
    updated_population_dict : dict of Organisms
        Dict of updated organisms, where organism states that conflict between
        intent_list and population_dict are resolved.

    Conflicts may be cases in which an organism has different states in the
    intent list, perhaps arrising from the actions of other organisms that
    somehow effect its state. This method resolves those conflicts, so that
    there is only one organism with a given organism id present in the final
    output list at all times.
